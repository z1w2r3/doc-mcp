## Standard Workflow 

- Analysis & Planning: First think through the problem systematically, read the codebase for relevant files and patterns, then write a detailed plan to docs/todo.md.
- Task Breakdown: The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
- Approval Process: Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
- Progressive Execution: Work through todos one by one, STOP for any blockers (never simplify to bypass), test each task immediately, and commit for easy rollback.
- Structured Reporting: Please give me a high level explanation of what changes you made after completing each todo item, noting any temporary solutions.
- Controlled Simplicity: Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
- Comprehensive Summary: Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of changes, any temporary solutions to complete later, and other relevant information.
